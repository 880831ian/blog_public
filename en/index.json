The following is a comparison of two search engines: lunr: simple, no need to synchronize index.json, no limit for contentLength, but high bandwidth and low performance (Especially for Chinese which needs a large segmentit library) algolia: high performance and low bandwidth, but need to synchronize index.json and limit for contentLength The content of the post is separated by h2 and h3 HTML tag to improve query performance and basically implement full-text search. contentLength is used to limit the max index length of the part starting with h2 and h3 HTML tag. Tips about algolia You need to upload index.json files to algolia to activate searching. You could upload the index.json files by browsers but a CLI tool may be better. Algolia Atomic is a good choice. To be compatible with Hugo multilingual mode, you need to upload different index.json for each language to the different index of algolia, such as zh-cn/index.json or fr/index.json… ","date":"2020-03-06","objectID":"/en/theme-documentation-basics/:5:2","tags":["installation","configuration"],"title":"Theme Documentation - Basics","uri":"/en/theme-documentation-basics/"},{"categories":["documentation"],"content":"Find out how to create and organize your content quickly and intuitively in FeelIt theme.","date":"2020-03-05","objectID":"/en/theme-documentation-content/","tags":["content","Markdown"],"title":"Theme Documentation - Content","uri":"/en/theme-documentation-content/"},{"categories":["documentation"],"content":"Find out how to create and organize your content quickly and intuitively in FeelIt theme.

You can reference page resources by the value for Resources.GetMatch or the filepath of the resource relative to the page directory directly. Store resources in the assets directory, which is /assets by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the assets directory. Store resources in the static directory, which is /static by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the static directory. The priority of references is also in the above order.

Copy-tex Copy-tex is an extension for $ \\KaTeX $. By the extension, when selecting and copying $ \\KaTeX $ rendered elements, copies their $ \\LaTeX $ source to the clipboard. Set the property copyTex = true under [params.math] in your site configuration to enable Copy-tex. Select and copy the formula rendered in the previous section, and you can find that the copied content is the LaTeX source code. mhchem mhchem is an extension for $ \\KaTeX $. By the extension, you can write beautiful chemical equations easily in the article. Set the property mhchem = true under [params.math] in your site configuration to enable mhchem. $$ \\ce{CO2 + C -\u003e 2 CO} $$ $$ \\ce{Hg^2+ -\u003e[I-] HgI2 -\u003e[I-] [Hg^{II}I4]^2-} $$ The rendered output looks like this: $$ \\ce{CO2 + C -\u003e 2 CO} $$ $$ \\ce{Hg^2+ -\u003e[I-] HgI2 -\u003e[I-] [Hg^{II}I4]^2-} $$ ","date":"2020-03-05","objectID":"/en/theme-documentation-content/:5:2","tags":["content","Markdown"],"title":"Theme Documentation - Content","uri":"/en/theme-documentation-content/"},{"categories":["documentation"],"content":"Ruby Annotation An extended Markdown syntax for ruby annotation is supported in FeelIt theme: [Hugo]^(An open-source static site generator) The rendered output looks like this: HugoAn open-source static site generator ","date":"2020-03-05","objectID":"/en/theme-documentation-content/:5:3","tags":["content","Markdown"],"title":"Theme Documentation - Content","uri":"/en/theme-documentation-content/"},{"categories":["documentation"],"content":"Fraction An extended Markdown syntax for fraction is supported in FeelIt theme: [Light]/[Dark] [99]/[100] The rendered output looks like this: Light/Dark 90/100 ","date":"2020-03-05","objectID":"/en/theme-documentation-content/:5:4","tags":["content","Markdown"],"title":"Theme Documentation - Content","uri":"/en/theme-documentation-content/"},{"categories":["documentation"],"content":"Font Awesome FeelIt theme uses Font Awesome as the icon library.

Let’s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits are: Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. – John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!
